## Background

The reviewer application we have deployed consists of two pods running within a virtual network.

* **UI** runs nginx and serves a single page application
* **API** runs a .NET Web Application that talks to Azure SQL and Blob Storage

The architecture looks like this:

**TODO** Insert architecture diagram

The UI pod does not require any access to Azure resources. It's good practice to ensure that traffic is restricted for this application

## Challenge

* Network Policy - restricting pod to pod communications
* Enforce tagging of assets
* **TODO** Is there a way to give a report on it?

Apply a network policy to restrict traffic to and from the UI pod

## Success Criteria

From the UI pod `curl reviewer-api.prod.svc.cluster.local` should error

**TODO** Is there a difference between AKS and Azure Arc for Kubernetes? ( Deploy - Configure diagnostic settings for Azure Kubernetes Service to Log Analytics workspace ) - or - (Volumes should be encrypted at rest) **hint** some of these you won't be able to do :D
